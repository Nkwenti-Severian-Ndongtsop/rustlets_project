# we're learning rust!

Now, **we're really small**. We have very little idea what we're doing.

The oreohive organisation has only one real developer.

However, we really like the idea of Rust. So, **we're trying to learn Rust**.

But we'd rather not keep all this to ourselves! As we find out new things and build new toys to help us learn, **we'd love to help others learn, too**.

As such, **this is a public GitHub repo to publish our little toys**, to help others learn, too!

All other media, assets, resources or files you may find in this repo is published under **CC BY-NC-SA 4.0**.

*This may be overriden by any explicit licensing statements on, in or around any particular files or materials.*

In addition, your use of any code or such resources in this repo is governed and restricted by **the oreohive organisation's Terms & Ethics of Use**. You agree to these in engaging with, viewing, downloading or using any of our content at all, and you can view it and learn about it here.

While we encourage you learn about it, you **shouldn't need to worry**; it mostly puts restrictions in place like prohibiting for-profit use and AI training use, some of which are already enforced by our **standard licensing schemes**.

This might not be free software given the restrictions on some use cases we impose; any restrictions in our Terms & Ethics of Use take priority and do have the power to compromise on freedoms granted by the standard licenses we employ.

However, we try our best not to infringe on any freedoms you're netted by the GNU AGPL-3.0 and CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.

Thank you! We hope you understand. :)

Feel free to **reach out to us** if you have any questions!

*And no; we're **incredibly unlikely to ever actually pull you up** on use, so long as you don't harm us and respect our wishes in how you use our stuff. Your **general, personal use of our code just for your learning** is usually **completely fine**, so long as our code is implemented only into open-source projects. :)*
